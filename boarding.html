      "Ric â€“ Canâ€™t board without snacks. Last time he brought chips, they lived in the Mazda longer than some of our friendships.",
      "GAF â€“ Thinks he's a doctor, but almost killed me last time. Board at your own risk.",
      "Ray â€“ Always puts music in the carâ€¦ I just wish they were all good.",
      "If this flight had leg day, Vic wouldâ€™ve already been here.",
      "Brian probably missed this flight too. Classic.",
      "GAFâ€™s prescription for turbulence? Panadol and vibes.",
      "Kerkorâ€™s boarding pass says â€˜slide tackle readyâ€™. Proceed with caution.",
      "Jean â€“ Blasts French music like heâ€™s Paris-bornâ€¦ but studied in English and barely speaks French. Shouts on the road like he owns it and the soundtrack.",
      "Jean â€“ Plays French music at max volume, shouts like a rally driver, and somehow still asks what 'bonjour' means.",
      "No seatbelts, no snacksâ€¦ but I might be at your door in 15 minutes. Buckle up (emotionally).",
      "Delays? Never heard of her. I operate on vibes and Google Maps.",
      "Our in-flight service includes music from my busted speakers and sharp turns you didnâ€™t ask for.",
      "No turbulence. Just Lebanese roads.",
      "Book now. No refunds. No mercy.",
      "In case of emergency, pray I donâ€™t miss the exit.",
      "Now boarding: Anyone who can handle 180 km/h in a 50 zone.",
      "Ric â€“ Says he's not hungry. Then eats half your order and says, 'just tasting bro.'"
